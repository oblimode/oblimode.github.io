Room Temperature Developer License v1.1
https://oblimode.github.io/rtDevLicense

This license is created to ensure users copy and distribute only my public releases. 
Developer releases should not be made available to the everday user, and if an unauthorised user were to find a release, 
these are the terms they must follow. This is done because my Developer releases are often consistently unfinished, 
may have unexpected errors or have comments I would not want seen in a public release. 
Public releases may have a much fairer license, most likely something like MIT/GNU (or even public domain).
There is no guarantee that I "The Author" may actually do this.

1. For any conditions not outlined in the License, refer to your country or state laws for Copyright.

2. Excluding anyone authorised by/given written permission by The Author, you may not copy, distribute, modify, change copyright and mentions of, 
create derivative works and distribute derivative works of the Content. If possible, the Content must have a list of anyone authorised by, or
anyone given written permission by The Author.

3. The Author has explicit permission to revoke the license and permission to use the Content from anyone, 
including anyone previously and currently authorised by/given written permission by The Author at any time.

4. If you do not agree to any of the above conditions, you must delete the Content in its entirety.
