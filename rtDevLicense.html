<h1>Room Temperature Developer License</h1>

<h2>https://oblimode.github.io/rtDevLicense</h2>

<p>This license is created to ensure users copy and distribute only my public releases. Developer releases should not be made available to the everday user, and if an unauthorised user were to find a release, these are the terms they must follow. This is done because my Developer releases are often consistently unfinished, may have unexpected errors or have comments I would not want seen in a public release. Public releases will have a much fairer license, most likely something like MIT/GNU (or even public domain)
